#What is a loop? 
    #Repeats the code inside for a specified numbers of times
#What are the two types of loops?
    # for loops
    # while loop#
#What is iteration?
    # how many times the loop has run?
#What are lists? 
 # A list of things for the code
#How do you make lists in python? 
 # by making a list and making it run
#How do you make for loops in python? 
 
#How do you make while loops in python?

# for loop
foods = ["Chocolate", "Pasta", "Brownies", "Cookies", "Garlic", "Bread", "Fajitas"]
for food in foods:
    print(f"{food} is my favorite food!")

for x in range(1,20):
    print(x)

# while loop

#i = 0
#while True:
        #print(i)
        #i+= 1#
#Infinite loop !!!BAD!!!(missed one of the 3 steps)


#correct while loop
#i = 1


#while i < 20:
    #print(i)
    #i+=1

#x = 1

#hile x < 21:
    #if x % 2 == 0:
        #print(f"{x} is an even number")

    #else:
        #print(f"{x} is an odd number")
    #x += 1

#import random

#d = 1

#end = random.randint(1,20)

#while d != end:#
    #print("Duck")
    #d += 1

#print("Goose")

#while True:
    #if d == end:
        #print("Goose")
        #break
   #else:
        #print("duck")
        #d += 1#
