# AK 7th expressions notes

# What is an algorithm?
    # Answer 
name = input("hello, what is your name?")
print("hello", name)

#treyson has 12 apples, he has 5 friends that he wants to give apples to. How many apples does each friend get?
apples = 12
friends = 5
print("each friend gets", apples / friends, "apples")


# List steps in an algorithm
#1. variables(get needed info)
#2. do the equations(do the things)
#3. display results
# List ALL of the different mathematical operators (Give me the symbol and tell me what it does)
number_1 = 14
number_2 = 9
print("addition(+):", number_1 + number_2)
print("subtraction(-):", number_1 - number_2)
print("multiplitation(*):", number_1 * number_2)
print("division(/):", number_1 / number_2)
print("exponents(**):", number_1 ** number_2)
print("integer division:", number_1 // number_2)
print("muldo(%):", number_1 % number_2)
# List ALL of the different assignment operators (Give me the symbols and what it does)

# Why are expressions so important in programming?

# Average age of 4 people

# integers in programming are whole numbers

# floats in programming are numbers with decimals

# mudolo = remainder of a division problem
